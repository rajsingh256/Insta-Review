Grown Ups;5.9/10;There is nothing wrong about this film... there is nothing right about it either. It's just another Adam Sandler feel-good movie, and if you like these (I certainly do), you will like this movie too.;
Superbad;7.6/10;A superfunny film. The characters are interesting and the dialogue is completely nuts. You have to watch it. For anyone that knows how dumb the local smokeys are this film will completely resonate.;
21 Jump Street;7.2/10;The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is brilliant, and it's nice to see Tatum in something other than his standard rom-com or "rom" setting. I was already laughing from the first scene, which is generally hard to do and the humour was the correct balance of wit and slapstick.;
The Dictator;6.4/10;I do not know if it was my low expectations before the screening, but I actually enjoyed this movie very much. In order to enjoy this movie, however, you do have to somewhat detach yourself from thinking too much into the wealth of racist and crude humor contained in the movie.;
The Interview;6.8/10;The film had me laughing right off the bat and, aside from some parts that just weren't funny, was generally hilarious throughout. Even the ending was funny, satisfying, and overall well done.;
The Hangover;7.7/10;Top 10 comedies of all time. Enough jokes and hilarious situations to keep laughing long after the viewing. Sit back and enjoy the ride.;
Step Brothers;6.9/10;First up this film is STUPID it is ridiculous but it's a comedy with Will Ferrell in it what did you honestly expect?! But my god it's funny it really is hilarious Ferrell and Reilly make an awesome on screen team and the comedy moments just bounce off one an other, each man just helps make the others role as funny as it could have been.;
